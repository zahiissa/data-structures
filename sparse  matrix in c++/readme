A matrix is a two-dimensional data object made of m rows and n columns, therefore having total m x n values. If most of the elements of the matrix have 0 value, then it is called a sparse matrix.

# Why to use Sparse Matrix instead of simple matrix ?

Storage: There are lesser non-zero elements than zeros and thus lesser memory can be used to store only those elements.
Computing time: Computing time can be saved by logically designing a data structure traversing only non-zero elements..
